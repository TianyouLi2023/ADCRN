### Abstract  
Binaural reproduction (BR) on head-mounted devices (HMDs) transforms multi-microphone recordings into binaural signals. Conventional binaural signal matching (BSM) methods predict reproduction filters from predefined source distributions but suffer from degradation under mismatched configurations. Recent DNN-based BR approaches improve content accuracy and spatial fidelity, yet their heavy computational and parameter demands hinder deployment on resource-limited HMDs, and their effectiveness in such contexts remains insufficiently studied.  

This repository presents **ADCRN (Attention-enhanced Dual-path Convolutional Recurrent Network)**, a lightweight neural architecture featuring a dual-path recurrent bottleneck for temporalâ€“spectral modeling and efficient channel attention for cross-channel recalibration. Evaluations on simulated datasets derived from AR-glasses microphone arrays demonstrate that ADCRN achieves **state-of-the-art performance** in both objective and subjective assessments, with significantly reduced parameters and computational complexity.
